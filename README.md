Contains a Powershell script (that I developed years ago and I just found back... so I am storing it here not to lose it again) that generates a Numerology report based on a person's Name and Birth Date.
Just for fun.
PS - the formulas and logic were derived from some book I can't recall where my wife found it :-)
